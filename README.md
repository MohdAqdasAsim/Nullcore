## 🕹️ Nullcore – Game Overview

**Nullcore** is a 2D glitchpunk adventure set in a broken simulation where chaos isn’t the enemy—it’s the mechanic. Players navigate through surreal worlds warped by dynamic, community-driven glitches. From gravity reversals to time loops, no two sessions are ever the same. Every world in Nullcore is alive, reactive, and completely unpredictable—just like the bugs controlling it.

Whether you’re solving logic-defying puzzles, collecting Glitch Tokens, or collaborating with others to shape the next anomaly, Nullcore offers an immersive sandbox of absurdity, strategy, and creativity.
